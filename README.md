Hex Colors problem from /r/DailyProgrammer

This is my solution to this problem. I did it in Java. I included a test class that can be executed to see the code in action.
I used the examples cases that are on the reddit post. I changed one because it was incorrect. (the first blending example should be
#3B444C, instead of #3C444C)
